Forked from benhoyt/ht to generate 32-bit hashses and use in 32-bit uC


Simple hash table written in C. To go with my article **[How to implement a hash table (in C)](https://benhoyt.com/writings/hash-table-in-c/)**.

This is a learning exercise, not a battle-tested data structure library -- you have been warned! :-)
